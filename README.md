# Planar-data-classification-using-Neural-Network
Using a single hidden layer Neural Network, classified a planar or 2D data.

Built a 1 hidden layer Neural Network from scratch without using Keras library. Its a simple project trying to classify a binary data (red and blue
as you will see in the project). Very straight forward project to demonstrate the the working of Neural Network. Hope you have fun with it:)
